postmortem

OVERVIEW
--------

For a few years now, I've kept daily logs (hours worked, projects worked on, meetings & discussions and their subjects, plus a brief overview of successes & frustrations for the day) that I report to my manager. `postmortem` helps me automate various aspects of creating & organizing these "daily postmortems".

I doubt anyone else will find it of much use.
