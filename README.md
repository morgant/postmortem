postmortem

OVERVIEW
--------

For a few years now, I've kept daily logs (hours worked, projects worked on, meetings & discussions and their subjects, plus a brief overview of successes & frustrations for the day) that I report to my manager. `postmortem` helps me automate various aspects of creating & organizing these "daily postmortems".

I doubt anyone else will find it of much use. That said, it takes a lot of effort out of this relatively free-form report and the reports themselves are extremely helpful to me on a daily, weekly, and even annual basis.
